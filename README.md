### Hi there 👋

I'm an experienced risk analytics professional with a demonstrated history of working in the credit and fraud risk industry. I was involved in the deployment of predictive risk models for small and medium enterprises to help provide data driven decision support and strategy support to credit policy, collections, and product teams. I am skilled in analyzing large datasets in Python, R, SQL, SAS, and Excel, generating recommendations, and presenting them to the stakeholders through visuals in Microsoft PowerPoint and Tableau.

Currently, I am pursuing the Master of Science in Business Analytics at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. Through this program, I am seeking to further expand my breadth of technical knowledge of machine learning, formalize my business acumen, as well as get further industry exposure through experiential learning.

I am passionate about problems that can be solved through data, and I get excited by all such unexplored possibilities in our tech-driven world. Throughout my four years of work experience, I have been fascinated by how much a group of people can achieve through a structured project and the first questions I ask when I start working on a new business problem are "Why is this problem important?", and "What's the best way we can tackle this as a group?". I am always looking for opportunities where I can enhance my Data Analytics/Data Science Skills.
